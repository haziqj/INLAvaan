Bayesian structural equation modelling with INLA.

## First impression

The quintessential example of a structural equation model using Bollen's (1989) political democracy data.
This set includes data from 75 developing countries each assessed on four measures of democracy measured twice (1960 and 1965), and three measures of industrialization measured once (1960).
The following model is theorised.

We can fit this using `{INLAvaan}` as follows:

```{r}
myModel <- "
  # latent variables
  dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4
  dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8
  ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3

  # latent regressions
  dem60 ~ ind60
  dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60

  # residual covariances
  y1 ~~ y5
  y2 ~~ y4 + y6
  y3 ~~ y7
  y4 ~~ y8
  y6 ~~ y8
"

fit <- inlavaan(model = myModel, data = PoliticalDemocracy)
summary(fit)
```
