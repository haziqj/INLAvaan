## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version (0.2.2) I have:

* Added method reference to DESCRIPTION file.
* Added missing \value tag to fitMeasures.Rd detailing the return object.
* Replaced \dontrun with \donttest for long-running examples, and unwrapped examples that run in < 5s.
* Removed set.seed() in R/inlavaan.R.

## Explanation of NOTE

The note regarding 'INLA' being an abbreviation confirms that the full expansion ("Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation") is correctly present in the Description field.
