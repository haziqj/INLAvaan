## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added method reference to DESCRIPTION.
* Added missing \value tag to fitMeasures.Rd detailing the return object.
* Replaced \dontrun with \donttest in examples for those that can run in < 5s.
* Removed set.seed() in R/inlavaan.R

## Explanation of NOTE

The note regarding 'INLA' being an abbreviation confirms that the full expansion ("Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation") is correctly present in the Description field.
