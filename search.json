Path bb (Y ~ M) estimated 0.769 (true value 0.7). Path cc (Y ~ X) estimated -0.060. 95% Credible Interval [-0.296, 0.176] includes zero, correctly identifying direct effect. Indirect Effect abab estimated 0.401 (true value 0.35). interval [0.228, 0.589] cross zero, indicating significant mediation. sum direct indirect effects (c+abc + ab). tells us 1-unit increase XX leads total increase roughly 0.328 YY. Note: simulation, even though direct effect non-significant (close zero), total effect significant mechanism via MM strong. illustrates “full mediation” scenario: XX affects YY, MM.","code":"summary(fit) #> INLAvaan 0.2.1.9005 ended normally after 5 iterations #>  #>   Estimator                                      BAYES #>   Optimization method                           NLMINB #>   Number of model parameters                         7 #>  #>   Number of observations                           100 #>  #> Model Test (User Model): #>  #>    Marginal log-likelihood                    -311.858  #>    PPP (Chi-square)                              0.616  #>  #> Information Criteria: #>  #>    Deviance (DIC)                              568.630  #>    Effective parameters (pD)                     6.859  #>  #> Parameter Estimates: #>  #>    Marginalisation method                     SKEWNORM #>    VB correction                                  TRUE #>  #> Regressions: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   Y ~                                                                           #>     X          (c)   -0.060    0.120   -0.296    0.176    0.001    normal(0,10) #>   M ~                                                                           #>     X          (a)    0.525    0.109    0.311    0.740    0.000    normal(0,10) #>   Y ~                                                                           #>     M          (b)    0.769    0.101    0.572    0.966    0.000    normal(0,10) #>  #> Intercepts: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .Y                -0.070    0.100   -0.266    0.126    0.000    normal(0,32) #>    .M                 0.126    0.100   -0.071    0.323    0.000    normal(0,32) #>  #> Variances: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .Y                 0.976    0.145    0.732    1.299    0.004 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .M                 0.997    0.147    0.749    1.326    0.004 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>  #> Defined Parameters: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>     ab                0.401    0.099    0.228    0.589                          #>     total             0.328    0.131    0.093    0.560"},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://inlavaan.haziqj.ml/articles/missing.html","id":"simulate-data","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Simulate Data","title":"Missing Values","text":"","code":"library(INLAvaan) mod <- \"     # Latent variable definitions     ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3     dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4     dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8      # Latent regressions     dem60 ~ ind60     dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60      # Residual correlations     y1 ~~ y5     y2 ~~ y4 + y6     y3 ~~ y7     y4 ~~ y8     y6 ~~ y8   \" dat <- lavaan::PoliticalDemocracy  # Simulate missingness (MCAR) set.seed(161) mis <- matrix(rbinom(prod(dim(dat)), 1, 0.9), nrow(dat), ncol(dat)) datmiss <- dat * mis datmiss[datmiss == 0] <- NA"},{"path":"https://inlavaan.haziqj.ml/articles/missing.html","id":"listwise-deletion","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Listwise Deletion","title":"Missing Values","text":"","code":"fit1 <- asem(mod, datmiss, meanstructure = TRUE) #> ℹ Finding posterior mode. #> ✔ Finding posterior mode.

Looking output , can draw substantive conclusions based educational scenario: Level 1 [within] Regressions path fw ~ x1 0.509. suggests every unit increase x1 (e.g., Study Hours), student’s individual ability (fw) increases significantly. Level 2 [cluster] Regressions path fb ~ w1 0.164 suggests positive relationship school-level factors (like Teacher Experience) overall School Quality (fb), though standard deviation wider due smaller sample size Level 2 (n=200n=200 schools vs n=2500n=2500 students). Latent Variables: loadings y1, y2, y3 fw fb significant (0 included credible interval) thus confirm survey items effectively measure individual ability school-level quality.","code":"summary(fit) #> INLAvaan 0.2.1.9005 ended normally after 108 iterations #>  #>   Estimator                                      BAYES #>   Optimization method                           NLMINB #>   Number of model parameters                        20 #>  #>   Number of observations                          2500 #>   Number of clusters [cluster]                     200 #>  #> Model Test (User Model): #>  #>    Marginal log-likelihood                  -12185.526  #>    PPP (Chi-square)                              0.014  #>  #> Information Criteria: #>  #>    Deviance (DIC)                            24252.889  #>    Effective parameters (pD)                    49.829  #>  #> Parameter Estimates: #>  #>    Marginalisation method                     SKEWNORM #>    VB correction                                  TRUE #>  #>  #> Level 1 [within]: #>  #> Latent Variables: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   fw =~                                                                         #>     y1                1.000                                                     #>     y2                0.774    0.034    0.708    0.843    0.003    normal(0,10) #>     y3                0.734    0.033    0.670    0.800    0.001    normal(0,10) #>  #> Regressions: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   fw ~                                                                          #>     x1                0.509    0.023    0.464    0.555    0.000    normal(0,10) #>     x2                0.407    0.022    0.363    0.450    0.000    normal(0,10) #>     x3                0.205    0.021    0.163    0.246    0.000    normal(0,10) #>  #> Intercepts: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .y1                0.000                                                     #>    .y2                0.000                                                     #>    .y3                0.000                                                     #>    .fw                0.000                                                     #>  #> Variances: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .y1                0.988    0.046    1.081    0.901    0.001 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .y2                1.069    0.039    0.994    1.148    0.000 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .y3                1.013    0.037    0.943    1.087    0.000 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .fw                0.547    0.040    0.630    0.471    0.001 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>  #>  #> Level 2 [cluster]: #>  #> Latent Variables: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   fb =~                                                                         #>     y1                1.000                                                     #>     y2                0.725    0.052    0.628    0.834    0.006    normal(0,10) #>     y3                0.590    0.047    0.499    0.682    0.001    normal(0,10) #>  #> Regressions: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   fb ~                                                                          #>     w1                0.164    0.079    0.320    0.009    0.000    normal(0,10) #>     w2                0.130    0.077    0.281   -0.020    0.000    normal(0,10) #>  #> Intercepts: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .y1                0.024    0.075   -0.123    0.172    0.000    normal(0,32) #>    .y2               -0.017    0.060   -0.133    0.100    0.000    normal(0,32) #>    .y3               -0.042    0.054   -0.149    0.064    0.000    normal(0,32) #>    .fb                0.000                                                     #>  #> Variances: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .y1                0.072    0.045    1.347    0.008    0.066 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .y2                0.125    0.031    0.301    0.072    0.002 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .y3                0.155    0.029    0.216    0.105    0.001 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .fb                0.922    0.121    0.710    1.184    0.001 gamma(1,.5)[sd]"},{"path":"https://inlavaan.haziqj.ml/authors.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Authors","title":"Authors and Citation","text":"Haziq Jamil.
