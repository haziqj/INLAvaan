Path bb (Y ~ M) estimated 0.771 (true value 0.7). Path cc (Y ~ X) estimated -0.060. 95% Credible Interval [-0.291, 0.171] includes zero, correctly identifying direct effect. Indirect Effect abab estimated 0.403 (true value 0.35). interval [0.249, 0.593] cross zero, indicating significant mediation. sum direct indirect effects (c+abc + ab). tells us 1-unit increase XX leads total increase roughly 0.347 YY. Note: simulation, even though direct effect non-significant (close zero), total effect significant mechanism via MM strong. illustrates “full mediation” scenario: XX affects YY, MM.","code":"summary(fit) #> INLAvaan 0.2.2.9000 ended normally after 5 iterations #>  #>   Estimator                                      BAYES #>   Optimization method                           NLMINB #>   Number of model parameters                         7 #>  #>   Number of observations                           100 #>  #> Model Test (User Model): #>  #>    Marginal log-likelihood                    -311.858  #>    PPP (Chi-square)                              0.612  #>  #> Information Criteria: #>  #>    Deviance (DIC)                              568.307  #>    Effective parameters (pD)                     6.697  #>  #> Parameter Estimates: #>  #>    Marginalisation method                     SKEWNORM #>    VB correction                                  TRUE #>  #> Regressions: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   Y ~                                                                           #>     X          (c)   -0.060    0.118   -0.291    0.171    0.000    normal(0,10) #>   M ~                                                                           #>     X          (a)    0.525    0.108    0.315    0.736    0.000    normal(0,10) #>   Y ~                                                                           #>     M          (b)    0.771    0.099    0.577    0.964    0.000    normal(0,10) #>  #> Intercepts: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .Y                -0.071    0.098   -0.263    0.122    0.000    normal(0,32) #>    .M                 0.126    0.099   -0.068    0.319    0.000    normal(0,32) #>  #> Variances: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .Y                 0.977    0.145    0.733    1.303    0.006 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .M                 0.998    0.147    0.749    1.325    0.006 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>  #> Defined Parameters: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>     ab                0.403    0.095    0.249    0.593                          #>     total             0.347    0.126    0.105    0.587"},{"path":[]},{"path":"https://inlavaan.haziqj.ml/articles/missing.html","id":"simulate-data","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Simulate Data","title":"Missing Values","text":"","code":"library(INLAvaan) mod <- \"     # Latent variable definitions     ind60 =~ x1 + x2 + x3     dem60 =~ y1 + y2 + y3 + y4     dem65 =~ y5 + y6 + y7 + y8      # Latent regressions     dem60 ~ ind60     dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60      # Residual correlations     y1 ~~ y5     y2 ~~ y4 + y6     y3 ~~ y7     y4 ~~ y8     y6 ~~ y8   \" dat <- lavaan::PoliticalDemocracy  # Simulate missingness (MCAR) set.seed(221) mis <- matrix(rbinom(prod(dim(dat)), 1, 0.99), nrow(dat), ncol(dat)) datmiss <- dat * mis datmiss[datmiss == 0] <- NA"},{"path":"https://inlavaan.haziqj.ml/articles/missing.html","id":"listwise-deletion","dir":"Articles","previous_headings":"","what":"Listwise Deletion","title":"Missing Values","text":"","code":"fit1 <- asem(mod, datmiss, meanstructure = TRUE) #> ℹ Finding posterior mode. #> ✔ Finding posterior mode.

Looking output , can draw substantive conclusions based educational scenario: Level 1 [within] Regressions path fw ~ x1 0.510. suggests every unit increase x1 (e.g., Study Hours), student’s individual ability (fw) increases significantly. Level 2 [cluster] Regressions path fb ~ w1 0.164 suggests positive relationship school-level factors (like Teacher Experience) overall School Quality (fb), though standard deviation wider due smaller sample size Level 2 (n=200n=200 schools vs n=2500n=2500 students). Latent Variables: loadings y1, y2, y3 fw fb significant (0 included credible interval) thus confirm survey items effectively measure individual ability school-level quality.","code":"summary(fit) #> INLAvaan 0.2.2.9000 ended normally after 108 iterations #>  #>   Estimator                                      BAYES #>   Optimization method                           NLMINB #>   Number of model parameters                        20 #>  #>   Number of observations                          2500 #>   Number of clusters [cluster]                     200 #>  #> Model Test (User Model): #>  #>    Marginal log-likelihood                  -12185.526  #>    PPP (Chi-square)                              0.008  #>  #> Information Criteria: #>  #>    Deviance (DIC)                            24262.942  #>    Effective parameters (pD)                    54.856  #>  #> Parameter Estimates: #>  #>    Marginalisation method                     SKEWNORM #>    VB correction                                  TRUE #>  #>  #> Level 1 [within]: #>  #> Latent Variables: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   fw =~                                                                         #>     y1                1.000                                                     #>     y2                0.774    0.034    0.708    0.843    0.004    normal(0,10) #>     y3                0.734    0.033    0.671    0.801    0.003    normal(0,10) #>  #> Regressions: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   fw ~                                                                          #>     x1                0.510    0.023    0.465    0.555    0.001    normal(0,10) #>     x2                0.407    0.022    0.364    0.451    0.001    normal(0,10) #>     x3                0.205    0.021    0.164    0.246    0.000    normal(0,10) #>  #> Intercepts: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .y1                0.000                                                     #>    .y2                0.000                                                     #>    .y3                0.000                                                     #>    .fw                0.000                                                     #>  #> Variances: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .y1                0.987    0.046    1.079    0.899    0.001 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .y2                1.069    0.039    1.147    0.994    0.001 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .y3                1.013    0.037    1.087    0.943    0.001 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .fw                0.548    0.041    0.631    0.472    0.003 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>  #>  #> Level 2 [cluster]: #>  #> Latent Variables: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   fb =~                                                                         #>     y1                1.000                                                     #>     y2                0.717    0.051    0.622    0.821    0.021    normal(0,10) #>     y3                0.587    0.047    0.497    0.682    0.007    normal(0,10) #>  #> Regressions: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>   fb ~                                                                          #>     w1                0.164    0.079    0.010    0.318    0.000    normal(0,10) #>     w2                0.130    0.076   -0.020    0.279    0.000    normal(0,10) #>  #> Intercepts: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .y1                0.024    0.075   -0.122    0.171    0.000    normal(0,32) #>    .y2               -0.016    0.060   -0.134    0.102    0.000    normal(0,32) #>    .y3               -0.042    0.054    0.064   -0.149    0.001    normal(0,32) #>    .fb                0.000                                                     #>  #> Variances: #>                    Estimate       SD     2.5%    97.5%     NMAD    Prior        #>    .y1                0.066    0.039    1.269    0.006    0.042 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .y2                0.125    0.031    0.330    0.069    0.011 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .y3                0.155    0.029    0.291    0.104    0.002 gamma(1,.5)[sd] #>    .fb                0.919    0.120    1.174    0.703    0.002 gamma(1,.5)[sd]"},{"path":"https://inlavaan.haziqj.ml/authors.html","id":null,"dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Authors","title":"Authors and Citation","text":"Haziq Jamil.
