**Soon-ish features**

1. Model fit indices (PPP, xIC, RMSEA, etc.)
2. Prior specification.
3. Fixed values and/or parameter constraints.
4. Specify different families for different observed variable. 
5. Standardised coefficients.

**Long term plan**

1. "Non-iid" models, such as spatio-temporal models.
2. Multilevel-ish kind of models (2-3 levels).
3. Covariates.
4. Multigroup analysis (in principle this is simple, but I have bigger plans for this).
5. Missing data imputation.
